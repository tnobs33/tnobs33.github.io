Hello, I am a 2nd year student at The Ohio State University, pursuing my Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with
 a specialization in Information Systems. I am interested in solving real world business problems with technical
 solutions. I am looking for any internship/co-op opportunities that involve business and technology.
