<H1>Welcome to my Web Page!</H1>

<H2>My name is Tyler Noble. I am in the 11th grade and attend DeerLakes school district. I moved from
the Freeport area when I was 1, and I now live on on Christy Road, Tarentum PA 15084.
I have played basketball, baseball, football, golf and volleyball in my career. But
right now, I only play basketball and volleyball. I enjoy spending time with
my friends and family, watching netflix, and sleeping. I hope to attend a college in the future</H2>
